package nl.jolanrensen.tuplesInKotlin

/**
 * This file provides functions to easily extend Scala Tuples.
 *
 * This means you can easily create a new tuple appended-, or prepended by a new value or tuple.
 *
 * For example (using tupleOf() to create a new tuple):
 * ```tupleOf(a, b).appendedBy(c) == tupleOf(a, b, c)```
 * and
 * ```tupleOf(a, b).prependedBy(c) == tupleOf(c, a, b)```
 *
 * or in shorthand:
 * ```tupleOf(a, b)..c == tupleOf(a, b, c)```
 * and
 * ```c..tupleOf(a, b) == tupleOf(c, a, b)```
 *
 * Note that ```tupleOf(a, b)..tupleOf(c, d)``` will not work due to it being ambiguous:
 * It could mean both ```tupleOf(a, b, tupleOf(c, d))``` and ```tupleOf(tupleOf(a, b), c, d)```.
 * So, for two tuples, you must use [appendedBy] and [prependedBy] explicitly.
 *
 * For concatenating two tuples, see [nl.jolanrensen.scalaTuplesInKotlin.concat].
